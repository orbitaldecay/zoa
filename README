*} |h1 zoa: serialized structured data and it's textual representation|

|> This document is written using zoat (find out more below!).|

zoa is a set of standards related to serialized structured data and it's textual
representation and processing. It is part of the |&{Civboot| http://civboot.org}
project, specifically |&{fngi| http://github.com/civboot/fngi}.

|> zoa is named after "protozoa", which is itself a nod to protobufs. Yes, I'm
aware protozoa are not fungi, but the name was too good.|

zoa encompases the following technologies:|
|lu{
  #zoab# |`.zoa`: a structured data composed of only bytes and array.|
  #zoat# |`.zoa`: an extensible text format for representing zoab in a human readable
    way. Zoat intentionally has little functionality on it's own but allows
    extensibility and a standardized syntax for the different tools built on top
    of it.|
  #ZoaMark# |`.zm`: a markup language built on zoat, similar in some ways to
    "Markdown".|
  #zoac# |`.zc`: a configuration lanugage built on zoat and fngi, allowing execution of
    arbitrary fngi functions with specific requirements.|
  #zoash# |`.zh`: a text-based shell built on zoac allowing creating of processes,
    mutation of files or anything else a computer user might want to do.
    zoac functions are still callable to process data, but other functions are
    available as well perform side effects.
    File extension: .zh|
}

|> Yes, zoab and zoat have the same file extension. This is intentional and you
   will see how below!|

Both zoab and zoat are extremely simple. zoat is simpler than yaml but can
achieve the same functionaly but with far less ambiguitity. The only thing it
is missing is integer/float/literal-map/none types, which are not actually
necessary for serializing or deserializing arbitrary structured data. Zoat also
has massively increased functionality over yaml with features like variable
storage and concatenation.

zoab on the other hand is about the simplest possible general purpose structured
data that can exist. Having only two types allows it to be compact and fast.
The use of single byte signals alows it to be trivially deserialized by even
embedded system.|

{**************
*} |h2 zoat

zoat (like zoab) has only two data types: bytes and array. Bytes start at the
first non-whitespace character (except for '|' or '{', which we will get to) and
continue until a pipe. For example:
|===
  This is a zoat string. It ends with a pipe|
===

An array is specified using curly braces and can be nested, like this:
|===
  { first string in array|
    second string in array|
    { nested array element 1|
      nested array element 2|
    }
  }
===

Leading whitespace is always ignored until the first character, after which
newlines are treated as spaces and special characters use c-like escapes. Here
are the valid escapes in text:
|===
  \n          newline
  \t          tab
  \|          a literal '|' character
  \{          a literal '{' character
  \}          a literal '}' character
  \s
  \           a literal space character
  \xHH        hex byte of value 0xHH
  \<newline>  line continuation. When \ is used at the end of a line no
              space will be insert when going to the next line.


      An example,
      there is one space after the comma above. \
      \  However there are three spaces after the period since
      an escape was used both before and after the newline.|
===


The following are how to use commands. Commands must be specified immediately
following either a pipe or curly brace:|
|===
  |X          Where X is a non-whitespace character. Runs a command, some of
              which are defined below. Note that multiple '|' together are
              ignored, i.e. '|| | | ||' is the same as '|'.

  {           Starts an array. Characters following are always treated as text
              (never a command), but whitespace is still ignored. Example:
                {array item 1| array item 2}

  }           Ends an array. Characters following are always treated as text
              (never a command), but whitespace is still ignored. Example above.

              Note: {{}} will create an empty array inside a array. However,
              adding '|' does nothing. i.e. '|{| {||} |}|' is exactly the same.
              This allows for trailing pipes. If you've ever used JSON you know
              the pain of not being able to use trailing commas, this avoids
              that pain.

  | <bytes>   A set of bytes until the next '|', '{' or '}'. There _must_ be
              whitespace (newline, tab or space) after | otherwise the character
              will be treated as a command. Whitespace will be ignored until the
              first non-whitespace character.

  |\          Starts text immediately using the escape. Example:
                  |\nThis text started on a new line.|

  |*          Line comment. Text is ignored until a newline.

  {*          Block comment {*nesting allowed*}, it must be closed with: *}
              After a closing block comment a new command can start immediately.
              Example:
                  {* comment *} |h1 header

  |'''        Plain-text/code block. Any number of ' can be used, and must be
              escaped with the same number of ', which ends the item (but will
              not execute a command. As a general rule only '|' executes
              commands). The raw text will ignore escapes (i.e. \n) and preserve
              newlines, _except_ for the first newline if it immediately follows
              the opening ' block or the last newline if it immediately preceeds
              the ' block. Also, the text will be de-indented by the indent at
              the start of the command. Example:
                |'''
                This is some raw text.
                It will have no indent.
                I can use { | } \n etc and they are interpreted literally.
                I can even end with a space. '''
                This is a new item, as if the previous had ended with pipe|

  |+          Concatenate (join) this item to the last item of the same type.
              Note that text starts immediately.
              Example:
                all one |+single item. ==> all one single item.|
                {1| 2} |+ {3| 4}       ==> {1| 2| 3| 4}

  |.          Begins the variable compiler, similar to fngi's. When assigning
              variables, values are not added until referenced. Examples:
                |.foo = fngi |              |* set foo equal to "fngi "
                { I think |.foo|is great } |* { I think |fngi |is great }
              An array can be accessed by index using @<index>
                |.myArray @0 @3|            |* C equivalent: myArray[0][3]
              If the data is an array of two-length arrays with strings as the
              first item, you can access by key with '.'. Whitespace or special
              characters in the keys are not supported.
                |.myDict.foo.bar|

  |.+         Joins the variable to the last item. Example:
                { I think |.+foo|+is great } |* { I think fngi is great }

  |[0-9]      An integer (big-endian). 0x (hex), 0b (binary) and 0c (char) are
              supported. (see Type Specification Dyn)

  |-          A negative integer (big-endian, see Type Specification Dyn)

  |<char>     Other single-character commands are implemented by extensions,
              such as ZoaMark
===

The following are ZoaMark extensions:
|====
  |/          (inline) italicized until / Example: 'The cheese is |/very/ good.'

  |#          (inline) bold until # Example: 'The cheese is |#very# good.'

  |_          (inline) underlined until _ Example: 'The cheese is |_very_ good.'

  |&          (inline) path or link (URL). Commonly called a "reference" Example:
                  Part of the |&{Civboot| http://civboot.org} project.
              Can also be used as just the link:
                  Part of the |&http://civboot.org| project.

  |`          (inline) code until closing `. Any number of ` can be used:
                  Some code: |``this is ` all ` inline code`` wasn't that nice?

  |>          a "note" block. Use like:
                |>  This is a note
                    with no newlines.|
                or
                |>{
                  This is a note,|
                  With one newline.|
                }

  |hN         header block, use one of h1 h2 h3 h4. Ignores leading spaces.

  |lX         list block where X is a character. ln is a numbered list, lu is an
              un-numbered list. Example:
                  |lu{list item| other list item }

  |==         code block. Similar to ' blocks but will be rendered correctly.
              Any number of == can be used. Example:
                  |=== this is a code block that has == inside it. ===
====

Most text in ZoaMark is written using normal text strings, with pipes breaking
up the paragraphs. However, the following commands are treated as "inline" by
renderers:|
|==
Inline commands:
  |/.../      italic
  |#...#      bold
  |_..._      underlined
  |&<link>    reference/link
  |`...`      inline code
==

For example, you can make|/italic/ |#bold# or |_underlined_ text pretty easily.
You can also |&{insert a link| http://civboot.org} or |`some code`, or
make a |&bare reference|. All of these happen inline.|

> Note above: |`|& ...|.` does |/not/ execute the '.' compiler becuase the
> finding of |`|` is done by '&' which does not execute commands.

{**************
*} |h2 zoab: structured array and byte data.

The binary representation of zoa is called zoab. Like zoat it is composed of
only two types: bytes an array. Both can only have sections of length 63, but a
join bit may be used to make longer values.|

The start of a zoab item has a single byte which specifies it's type, join
status and length. it looks like:|

|===
  JTLL LLLL : J=join bit   T=type bit   L=length bits (0-63)
===

|lu{
  J: can be 1, which will cause it to be "joined" to the next item (which must
    be the same type). This allows the true length to be longer than 63 (any
    length is possible with multiple joins).|
  T: can be 0 for "bytes" or 1 for "array"|
  L: contains a length (0-63) of the bytes or array|
}

{**************
*} |h2 Binary Runtime Type Selection

There is one byte that is invalid for both zoab and utf8 (and ascii):
|`J=1 T=0 L=0`, which in binary is |`1000 0000` or in hex is 0x80.|

Instead of making this byte illegal, we will _require_ it in the |`zoa(...)`
function, which is intended to deserialize either zoab or zoat from user
inputs, data stored in file systems or data transferred over the wire. If 0x80
is the first character then it is assumed this is zoab data. If 0x80
is |/not/ the first byte then it should be assumed that the file/etc is
human written zoat.|

|> 0x80 will still be illegal for pure-zoab related functions, which expect the
data to already be deserialzed.|

0x80 will signal that the next byte "steam type". The supported ones are:|
|lu{
  0: pure unstructured data with no special meaning.|
  1: _mostly_ human readable data. i.e. struct fields are names, integers are in
    text format, etc. This is typically what should be passed to dbg logs, human
    readable compressed configs, etc.|
  2: protozoa data, which is similar to protobuf. Fields are represented by
    user-assigned integers, data is in binary format, etc. The deserializer
    obviously needs access to a backwards-compatible reference (i.e. a struct
    definition) to know how to deserialize this data.|
  3: log event, used for zoa's own core logging.
}

We also reserve J=1 T=1 L=0 to mean that the next bytes value is actually a
pointer to more data. This allows fngi (or other languages) to use a maximum
block size of 4kB while still permitting arbitrary length zoab data.|

{**************
*} |h2 Type Specification
> WARNING: This section is currently being worked on so is not yet polished.

Zoa also has a default type protocol and text specification for generating
serializers and deserializers for zoab data. These are typically contained in
`.zt` files.

Zoa types are specified in a language similar to protobufs, with a few key
differences. For an overview:

Native types include:
* Data, Int, Num, Time (integers: seconds, microseconds), Path
  (array of components)
* Arr(generic)
* IntMap(Int key, generic value), DataMap(Data key, generic value)
* Dyn: dynamic (runtime) type

Users can create their own struct types with the format below. Struct fields can
be positional or have an id. Default values can be provided, otherwise all
arguments are required.

```
\ Comments use '\' character
struct Foo [
  a: Int; \ positional required argument.
  b: Int = 0; \ positional argument with default.
  c: Data = ||; \ bytes argument with default.
  d:0 Int = 0; \ indexed argument with default.
  d:1 Arr[Int] = 0;
]
```

The struct protocol is:
* The first items contains the number of positional args P.
* The next P items contains the first P specified positional arguments.
  Any unspecified positional args must have a default value.
* Indexed args can be specified in any order.
* Any unspecified args must have a default.

Similarily, enumerated values can be defined. Enums must always specify their
id. All ids from [0 - max specified] must be declared (in any order).

```
struct Cheese [ isCheddar: Int ]
struct Cake [ isChocolate: Int ]
struct Pizza [
  cheese: Cheese = {
    isCheddar|1|
  };
  hasPeperoni: Int = 0;
]

enum Food [
  none:0; \ note: empty type, no data
  someNuts:3 Int; \ note: declared out of order (OK)
  pizza:1 Pizza;
  cake:2 Cake;
  cheeses:3 Arr[Cheese];
]
```

The enum protocol is:
* The first item contains the enum variant, i.e. noaccount, user, admin
* If the variant is not an `Arr` or `*Map`, the next item is the value.
* else, the next N values are the data for the array.


{***
*} |h3 Dyn type|
The Dyn type is essentially an enum, shown below.

It is intended both as a light signal for rendering, as well as for data
transmission. It's primary purpose is in log messages where human readable
output is important but the effort to create a structured format is too great
for the payoff. 95%+ of such cases can be solved with the following.

|==
enum Dyn {
  dynStr: Data,           \ 1 render utf-8
  dynData: Data,          \ 2 render hex bytes (big-endian)
  dynInt: Int,            \ 3 render decimal
  dynNum: Num,            \ 4 render float
  dynTime: Time           \ 5 render timestamp
  dynDuration: Num        \ 6 render duration (seconds)
  dynPath: Path           \ 7 render /unix/path

  dynArrDyn: Arr[Dyn]     \ 0x20
  dynArrInt: Arr[Int]     \ 0x21
  dynArr[native]          \ 0x20 + native (i.e. 0x24 for Num)

  dynIntMap: IntMap[Dyn]  \ 0x40
  dynIntMap[native]       \ 0x40 + native

  dynStrMap: DataMap[Dyn] \ 0x60
  dynStrMap[native]       \ 0x60 + native
}
==

{***
*} |h3 Path type|
The path type is an array. If the first path item is empty it is a root path
(i.e. /foo/bar). If the first item is not empty it is a relative path
(i.e. foo/bar). There are no other rules.


{***
*} |h3 Num type|
The Num type is an array of length two containing the value and mantissa. The
result is `value * 2^mantissa`. Both the value and mantissa can be negative.
